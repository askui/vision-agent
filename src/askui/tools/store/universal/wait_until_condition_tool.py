class WaitUntilConditionTool(Tool):
    """
    Tool for waiting until a condition is met or a timeout is reached.

    Polls a callable at a fixed interval. Returns as soon as the condition
    returns `True`, or when the maximum wait time is reached. During each
    interval between checks, a progress bar is shown in the console.

    Args:
        condition_check (Callable[[], bool]): Callable with no arguments
            invoked at each poll; return `True` when the condition is met,
            `False` otherwise.
        description (str): Short description of what the condition checks for,
            used in the tool description for the agent.
        max_wait_time (float, optional): Maximum time to wait in seconds.
            Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

    Example:
        ```python
        from pathlib import Path
        from askui import VisionAgent
        from askui.tools.store.universal import WaitUntilConditionTool

        def file_ready() -> bool:
            return Path("output/result.json").exists()

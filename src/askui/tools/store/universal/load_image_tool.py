class LoadImageTool(Tool):
    """
    Tool for loading images from a directory on the filesystem.

    This tool allows the agent to load and process images from the filesystem,
    making them available for analysis, comparison, or visual inspection. It
    supports common image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, etc.) and automatically
    scales images to fit within a target size for efficient processing. This is
    useful for tasks like analyzing screenshots, comparing visual elements,
    verifying image content, or providing visual context during execution.

    Args:
        base_dir (str | Path): The base directory path where images will be loaded
            from. All image paths will be relative to this directory.

    Example:
        ```python
        from askui import VisionAgent
        from askui.tools.store.universal import LoadImageTool

        with VisionAgent() as agent:
            agent.act(
                "Describe the logo image called 'logo.png'",
                tools=[LoadImageTool(base_dir="images")]
            )
        ```

    Example:
        ```python
        from askui import VisionAgent
        from askui.tools.store.universal import LoadImageTool

        with VisionAgent(
            act_tools=[LoadImageTool(base_dir="images")]
